## Introduction:

In this data analysis project, we will be attempting to answers the following questions:
 - Is there a noticable disparities in the general health and healthcare accessibility within historically marginalizes groups related to Covid-19?
 - Are there counties in the United States that suffer a disproportionatly higher death rate than other places? 
 - Is there a correlation between high percentages of maringalize groups within the counties' population and the counties' high death rate?

The purpose of addressing these questions is to advocate for better healthcare accessibility for groups that are often overlooked during tumultuous time, and as a result, often experience greater health and social hardship. Therefore, it is necessary to understand which groups within society are suffering high infection and mortality rate relative to their overall population size. The report will focus on the studying the impact of racial and geographical disparities in healthcare relsting to Covid-19. 

## Methodology

Technique used:
- Data Wrangling
- Data Analysis and Visualization 
- Interactive Graphs


1. Data Wrangling and Cleaning (Please check out: Data Wrangling.ipynb)
- Collected Covid-19 data from the CDC databse (The dataset uses data from 2020).
- Eliminate any missing or errors within the dataset.
- Select and keep variables that are relevant to the project research top.
- Save the clean and truncated data into different csv files:
  -    Covid_Death_State_Counties_level.csv (Total covid-19 related death counts by all counties in the United States)
  -    Death_Counts_Race_Group.csv (Total covid-19 related death counts by racial groups)
  -    Vac_Race.csv (The numbers of covid-19 vaccine administered based on racial groups)
