Introduction:

Is there a noticable disparities in the general health and healthcare accessibility within historically marginalizes groups related to Covid-19? Are there counties in the United States that suffer a disproportionatly higher death rate than other places, and is correlated to the high percentages of maringalize groups within the counties' population?

It is necessary to address these questions in order to help improve historically marginalized groups gain better access to the healthcare they need during the Covid-19 pandemic, and hopefully, decrease the death rates within certain communities. This report focuses on the racial and geographical health disparities related to Covid-19. 

Technique used:
- Data Wrangling
- Data Analysis and Visualization 
- Statistics
- Interactive Graphs


1. Data Wrangling: (Please check out: Data Wrangling.ipynb)
- Extracted and collected data from the CDC databse. Created multiple dataframes and cleaned the data to ensure that only certain data of interest are kept for further analysis. The dataframes are then output into multiple csv files:
  -    Covid_Death_State_Counties_level.csv (Total covid-19 related death counts by all counties in the United States)
  -    Death_Counts_Race_Group.csv (Total covid-19 related death counts by racial groups)
  -    Vac_Race.csv (The numbers of covid-19 vaccine administered based on racial groups)
